Bonjour à tou•te•s

Pour ce meetup pré [Scala IO](scala.io), Ebiznext nous accueille pour parler de tests métamorphiques et de programmation fonctionnelle stack-safe et performante avec un retour d'expérience d'une librairie de batch.

-----------
## Much Ado About Testing — Nicolas Rinaudo

Testing is a wide field, with lots of weird concepts not much discussed in the industry.

This talk means to introduce:

* example based testing and how it falls short
* property based testing (PBT) and strategies to identify useful properties
* metamorphic testing for when PBT is too expensive

## 10 tips to write fast stack-safe functional code in Scala: the automatic-batching library experience report — Christophe Calvès

Have you ever heard the belief of functional programming being slow?

Have you ever been caught by a StackOverflowError in your recursive functions?

Have you ever rewritten your functional code into imperative style to make it fast and stack-safe?

What if i told you how to write fast and stack-safe functional code? Even for non tail-recursive functions! ;) In this talk i'll present you 10 tips to write fast and stack-safe functional code. It is based on my experience implementing [Auto-Batch](https://github.com/chrilves/auto-batch), a pure functional-programming Scala library to automatically batch API calls.
